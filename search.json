If you cannot attend to any of the sessions, please make sure to submit an extenuating circumstances through eVision.\nWe will use this website for learning applied data analysis. The website is not a substitute for module Blackboard. We will use this site in conjunction with Blackboard.\n\nFirst Task\nOur very first task is to install R and R Studio on our laptops.\nPlease try do this before coming to next lab.\nR and R Studio are very powerful tools for analysing data and for creating high-quality documents. I prepared this website using R Studio. It is widely used both in academic research and in commercial enterprise. Learning the fundamentals of these powerful tools gives you an advantage in the job market (or for pursuing further studies such as PhD). They are free and open source.\nMake sure to install R first and then the R Studio.\n\nR can be installed here: https://cran.r-project.org/\nR Studio can be install here: https://posit.co/downloads/\n\nInstructions for installing R and R Studio are available in Appendix A of the Online Textbook Hands-on Programming with R.",

    "text": "R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is an extremely powerful tool that we will use for data analysis and visualisations.\nR Studio is a customization of R. It runs R in the background and comes up with some additional features such as a very nice text editor.\nR Studio has four panes:\nAs default, the bottom left pane shows the console. This is where you can type your commands to R. However, we will discourage directly typing into the console. Instead, we will use the text editor, which is located above the console pane. This is where we will type our commands (and also comments). We will then run our code from the text editor. This will allow us to track what we have done. We can easily edit the code if we made a mistake. We can also save the commands for future use.\nThe upper right pane usually shows the environment by default. This is where our objects such as our data will be shown.\nYour environment would not include anything when you first open R Studio. It is the case because we have not imported any data or created any objects.\nFinally, the lower right pane displays files/folders, plots (that we will prepare) and help files. We will discuss this pane more in the future.",

We directly did a calculation using the console.\nThis would work, but it is not a good approach. Do not write your code directly to the console.
