Learning the fundamentals of these powerful tools gives you an advantage in the job market (or for pursuing further studies such as PhD).

    "text": "1.5 Create a simple dataset\nImagine that we have the names and birth years of a number of people. We cannot really hold each piece of information in separate objects. We would like to store them altogether in a single object, like a spreadsheet.\nLet’s start with names. We have five people:\n\nKeir Starmer\nRishi Sunak\nLiz Truss\nBoris Johnson\nTheresa May\nDavid Cameron\n\nWe can store their full names in a single object using the combine function c().\n\nnames_pm &lt;- c(\"Keir Starmer\",\n              \"Rishi Sunak\",\n              \"Liz Truss\",\n              \"Boris Johnson\",\n              \"Theresa May\",\n              \"David Cameron\",\n              \"Gordon Brown\",\n              \"Tony Blair\")\n\nNote that each PMs name is written within quotation and they are combined together with the function c(). Each item within c() is separated with a comma. Let’s see the object:\n\nnames_pm\n#&gt; [1] \"Keir Starmer\"  \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\"\n#&gt; [5] \"Theresa May\"   \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nGreat! We have the names of the last six UK PMs.\nYou may have realized that there are numbers in squared brackets in the beginning of each line.\nThese numbers refer to the order in the sequence. For example, “Keir Starmer” is the first item whereas “Theresa May” is the fifth.\nYou can recall a particular item in the object using square brackets. Let’s print the first item in names_pm.\n\nnames_pm[1]\n#&gt; [1] \"Keir Starmer\"\n\nSimilarly, for the third item, you would use [3]:\n\nnames_pm[3]\n#&gt; [1] \"Liz Truss\"\n\nFind the fifth name in the object.\n\nnames_pm[5]\n#&gt; [1] \"Theresa May\"\n\nYou can add more than one number into the square brackets using the c() function. For example, who are the second and fourth names?\n\nnames_pm[c(2,4)]\n#&gt; [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Boris Johnson\"\n\nNext, let’s write down their birth year. The order is important! You need to keep the same order with PMs.\n\nbirth_years &lt;- c(1962, # Keir Starmer\n                 1980, # Rishi Sunak\n                 1975, # Liz Truss\n                 1964, # Boris Johnson\n                 1956, # Theresa May\n                 1966, # David Cameron\n                 1951, # Gordon Brown\n                 1953  # Tony Blair)\n                 )\n\nCheck the object we just created.\n\nbirth_years\n#&gt; [1] 1962 1980 1975 1964 1956 1966 1951 1953\n\nLet’s put them together in a spreadsheet. What we would like to do is to vertically bind the two objects, which is called column bind and denoted with cbind().\n\ncbind(names_pm, birth_years)\n#&gt;      names_pm        birth_years\n#&gt; [1,] \"Keir Starmer\"  \"1962\"     \n#&gt; [2,] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"1980\"     \n#&gt; [3,] \"Liz Truss\"     \"1975\"     \n#&gt; [4,] \"Boris Johnson\" \"1964\"     \n#&gt; [5,] \"Theresa May\"   \"1956\"     \n#&gt; [6,] \"David Cameron\" \"1966\"     \n#&gt; [7,] \"Gordon Brown\"  \"1951\"     \n#&gt; [8,] \"Tony Blair\"    \"1953\"\n\nSo far, we just printed this on our screen but we have not stored it in an object. Put this into an object.\n\nmy_data &lt;- cbind(names_pm, birth_years)\n\nCheck my_data.\n\nmy_data\n#&gt;      names_pm        birth_years\n#&gt; [1,] \"Keir Starmer\"  \"1962\"     \n#&gt; [2,] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"1980\"     \n#&gt; [3,] \"Liz Truss\"     \"1975\"     \n#&gt; [4,] \"Boris Johnson\" \"1964\"     \n#&gt; [5,] \"Theresa May\"   \"1956\"     \n#&gt; [6,] \"David Cameron\" \"1966\"     \n#&gt; [7,] \"Gordon Brown\"  \"1951\"     \n#&gt; [8,] \"Tony Blair\"    \"1953\"\n\nNote that birth_years are stored as text, not numbers. I know this because they are within quotation marks.\nIt is customary to keep spreadsheets as something called “data frames” in R. This will not change our data, but makes further operations easier by unlocking some of the features of R.\n\nmy_data &lt;- as.data.frame(my_data)\n\nWe can take a better look at the dataset using View() function.\n\nView(my_data)\n\nLet’s save our script.\n\n1.5.1 Variables in a data frame\nColumns in a data frame are also called variables. We have two variables in the dataset:\n\nnames_pm : Name of the UK PM\nbirth_years: Birth year of the PM\n\nThere are a few ways to access a variable. A straightforward approach is to use the $ notation:\n\n# 'name of the data frame'$'name of the variable' \nmy_data$names_pm\n#&gt; [1] \"Keir Starmer\"  \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\"\n#&gt; [5] \"Theresa May\"   \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nNow it is your turn. Display the birth_years variable.\n\nmy_data$birth_years\n#&gt; [1] \"1962\" \"1980\" \"1975\" \"1964\" \"1956\" \"1966\" \"1951\" \"1953\"\n\nYou can think this expression as a sentence in R. In plain English, this expression tells R to bring the variable names_pm within the data frame my_data. The symbol $ refers to the ‘within’ part of this sentence.\nJust like you can convey the same meaning using different sentence structures, there are different ways to do the same thing in R. This is because R is working exactly like a language: it is a language to communicate with the computer.\nAnother way is using the square brackets notation []. names_pm is the first column in the data frame. To get the variable, you could type the following:\n\nmy_data[,1]\n#&gt; [1] \"Keir Starmer\"  \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\"\n#&gt; [5] \"Theresa May\"   \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nNote that we did not simply write my_data[1]. There is a comma: my_data[,1]\nIn a spreadsheet, we have two dimensions: rows and columns. By convention, rows are considered as the first dimension, and columns are considered as the second. This is why we had to use a comma to designate that we are interested in columns. If left the first dimension unspecified, which tells R to bring everything.\nIf you want to get the first row, you would type the following:\n\nmy_data[1, ]\n#&gt;       names_pm birth_years\n#&gt; 1 Keir Starmer        1962\n\nTry it yourself; get the fourth row.\n\n\nShow the code\nmy_data[4,]\n#&gt;        names_pm birth_years\n#&gt; 4 Boris Johnson        1964\n\n\nLet’s put these together: you can tell R to bring a specific observation. For example, third row of second column.\n\nmy_data[3,2]\n#&gt; [1] \"1975\"\n\nYou can also ask for multiple items by plugging in the combine function.\n\nmy_data[c(3,4), 2]\n#&gt; [1] \"1975\" \"1964\"\n\nConsider the command above. Try to formulate it in plain English. What does it tell to do R?",
