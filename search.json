    "text": "1.5 Create a simple dataset\nImagine that we have the names and birth years of a number of people. We cannot really hold each piece of information in separate objects. We would like to store them altogether in a single object, like a spreadsheet.\nLet’s start with names. We have eight people:\n\nKeir Starmer\nRishi Sunak\nLiz Truss\nBoris Johnson\nTheresa May\nDavid Cameron\nGordon Brown\nTony Blair\n\nWe can store their full names in a single object using the combine function c().\n\nnames_pm &lt;- c(\"Keir Starmer\",\n              \"Rishi Sunak\",\n              \"Liz Truss\",\n              \"Boris Johnson\",\n              \"Theresa May\",\n              \"David Cameron\",\n              \"Gordon Brown\",\n              \"Tony Blair\")\n\nNote that each PMs name is written within quotation and they are combined together with the function c(). Each item within c() is separated with a comma. Let’s see the object:\n\nnames_pm\n#&gt; [1] \"Keir Starmer\"  \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\"\n#&gt; [5] \"Theresa May\"   \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nGreat! We have the names of the last six UK PMs.\nYou may have realized that there are numbers in squared brackets in the beginning of each line.\nThese numbers refer to the order in the sequence. For example, “Keir Starmer” is the first item whereas “Theresa May” is the fifth.\nYou can recall a particular item in the object using square brackets. Let’s print the first item in names_pm.\n\nnames_pm[1]\n#&gt; [1] \"Keir Starmer\"\n\nSimilarly, for the third item, you would use [3]:\n\nnames_pm[3]\n#&gt; [1] \"Liz Truss\"\n\nFind the fifth name in the object.\n\nnames_pm[5]\n#&gt; [1] \"Theresa May\"\n\nYou can add more than one number into the square brackets using the c() function. For example, who are the second and fourth names?\n\nnames_pm[c(2,4)]\n#&gt; [1] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Boris Johnson\"\n\nNext, let’s write down their birth year. The order is important! You need to keep the same order with PMs.\n\nbirth_years &lt;- c(1962, # Keir Starmer\n                 1980, # Rishi Sunak\n                 1975, # Liz Truss\n                 1964, # Boris Johnson\n                 1956, # Theresa May\n                 1966, # David Cameron\n                 1951, # Gordon Brown\n                 1953  # Tony Blair)\n                 )\n\nCheck the object we just created.\n\nbirth_years\n#&gt; [1] 1962 1980 1975 1964 1956 1966 1951 1953\n\nLet’s put them together in a spreadsheet. What we would like to do is to vertically bind the two objects, which is called column bind and denoted with cbind().\n\ncbind(names_pm, birth_years)\n#&gt;      names_pm        birth_years\n#&gt; [1,] \"Keir Starmer\"  \"1962\"     \n#&gt; [2,] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"1980\"     \n#&gt; [3,] \"Liz Truss\"     \"1975\"     \n#&gt; [4,] \"Boris Johnson\" \"1964\"     \n#&gt; [5,] \"Theresa May\"   \"1956\"     \n#&gt; [6,] \"David Cameron\" \"1966\"     \n#&gt; [7,] \"Gordon Brown\"  \"1951\"     \n#&gt; [8,] \"Tony Blair\"    \"1953\"\n\nSo far, we just printed this on our screen but we have not stored it in an object. Put this into an object.\n\nmy_data &lt;- cbind(names_pm, birth_years)\n\nCheck my_data.\n\nmy_data\n#&gt;      names_pm        birth_years\n#&gt; [1,] \"Keir Starmer\"  \"1962\"     \n#&gt; [2,] \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"1980\"     \n#&gt; [3,] \"Liz Truss\"     \"1975\"     \n#&gt; [4,] \"Boris Johnson\" \"1964\"     \n#&gt; [5,] \"Theresa May\"   \"1956\"     \n#&gt; [6,] \"David Cameron\" \"1966\"     \n#&gt; [7,] \"Gordon Brown\"  \"1951\"     \n#&gt; [8,] \"Tony Blair\"    \"1953\"\n\nNote that birth_years are stored as text, not numbers. I know this because they are within quotation marks.\nIt is customary to keep spreadsheets as something called “data frames” in R. This will not change our data, but makes further operations easier by unlocking some of the features of R.\n\nmy_data &lt;- as.data.frame(my_data)\n\nWe can take a better look at the dataset using View() function.\n\n# View(my_data)\n\nLet’s save our script.\n\n1.5.1 Variables in a data frame\nColumns in a data frame are also called variables. We have two variables in the dataset:\n\nnames_pm : Name of the UK PM\nbirth_years: Birth year of the PM\n\nThere are a few ways to access a variable. A straightforward approach is to use the $ notation:\n\n# 'name of the data frame'$'name of the variable' \nmy_data$names_pm\n#&gt; [1] \"Keir Starmer\"  \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\"\n#&gt; [5] \"Theresa May\"   \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nNow it is your turn. Display the birth_years variable.\n\nmy_data$birth_years\n#&gt; [1] \"1962\" \"1980\" \"1975\" \"1964\" \"1956\" \"1966\" \"1951\" \"1953\"\n\nYou can think this expression as a sentence in R. In plain English, this expression tells R to bring the variable names_pm within the data frame my_data. The symbol $ refers to the ‘within’ part of this sentence.\nJust like you can convey the same meaning using different sentence structures, there are different ways to do the same thing in R. This is because R is working exactly like a language: it is a language to communicate with the computer.\nAnother way is using the square brackets notation []. names_pm is the first column in the data frame. To get the variable, you could type the following:\n\nmy_data[,1]\n#&gt; [1] \"Keir Starmer\"  \"Rishi Sunak\"   \"Liz Truss\"     \"Boris Johnson\"\n#&gt; [5] \"Theresa May\"   \"David Cameron\" \"Gordon Brown\"  \"Tony Blair\"\n\nNote that we did not simply write my_data[1]. There is a comma: my_data[,1]\nIn a spreadsheet, we have two dimensions: rows and columns. By convention, rows are considered as the first dimension, and columns are considered as the second. This is why we had to use a comma to designate that we are interested in columns. If left the first dimension unspecified, which tells R to bring everything.\nIf you want to get the first row, you would type the following:\n\nmy_data[1, ]\n#&gt;       names_pm birth_years\n#&gt; 1 Keir Starmer        1962\n\nTry it yourself; get the fourth row.\n\n\nShow the code\nmy_data[4,]\n#&gt;        names_pm birth_years\n#&gt; 4 Boris Johnson        1964\n\n\nLet’s put these together: you can tell R to bring a specific observation. For example, third row of second column.\n\nmy_data[3,2]\n#&gt; [1] \"1975\"\n\nYou can also ask for multiple items by plugging in the combine function.\n\nmy_data[c(3,4), 2]\n#&gt; [1] \"1975\" \"1964\"\n\nConsider the command above. Try to formulate it in plain English. What does it tell to do R?",

A row vector typically shows an observation. A particular item, which is a cell in a spreadsheet, is a value. This is visualised in Figure 2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Variables, observations, rows. Well-organised data come in this form.\n\n\n\nWhen data do not come in this format, we will carry out something called data wrangling and reorganize the data so that each column is a variable, each row is an observation and each cell is a value.\nFor simplicity, however, the datasets we are working on already come in this shape.\n\n# A variable: a column (e.g., birth_years)\nmy_data$birth_years\n#&gt; [1] \"1962\" \"1980\" \"1975\" \"1964\" \"1956\" \"1966\" \"1951\" \"1953\"\n\n# An observation: a row (e.g., second row)\nmy_data[2,]\n#&gt;      names_pm birth_years\n#&gt; 2 Rishi Sunak        1980\n\n# A particular value (e.g., third row of second column)\nmy_data[3,2]\n#&gt; [1] \"1975\"",

Your folder names should be simple and easy to write. For example: research_methods is a good name.\nTry not to use space in file names. Underscore or dash are better alternatives. Also, I encourage always using lowercase for file names, which also goes for object names in R.\nYou can use your operating system to create this directory. You could also use R Studio’s Files tab. Put this folder somewhere easy to access.\nLet’s save your R script. You can use drop-down menu: File &gt;&gt; Save OR simply by using the keyboard shortcut .\nGive an intuitive name to your script. For example, learn_02.R is a good name.\nIt is generally good idea to keep your data in a sub-directory named data.

    "text": "3.2 Summary of a categorical variable\nLet’s describe a categorical variable. We can work with Geographical_Region, which records where a country is located geographically. To see how many countries are in each region, we can use table() and provide a descriptive summary of this variable.\n\ntable(df$Geographical_Region)\n#&gt; \n#&gt;                   Africa                 Americas                     Asia \n#&gt;                       47                       27                       30 \n#&gt;                   Europe Mid. East & North Africa                   Ocenia \n#&gt;                       39                       17                        6\n\nNow, we have a frequency table of Geographical_Region. I can see that 47 countriese are in Africa, 27 in Americas and so on. For categorical variables, a frequency table is appropriate for a descriptive summary.\nWe can also create a bar plot and visually summarize the data. Each bar will represent the number of countries in each geographical region. In short, we will visually display the information in table(df$Geographical_Region) using a barplot.\n\nbarplot(height = table(df$Geographical_Region))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a good start, but we will do better. Before going any further, let’s unpack the code. The function barplot() takes a vector of numbers, which it uses to display heights. For instance, if we want to display four bars with heights 5, 10, 12 and 7, we can plug such a vector into barplot().\n\nbarplot(height = c(5,10,12,7))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that bars above don’t have labels at the moment, because we did not provide any information. For Geographical_Region, however, table() creates a named vector.\n\n# df$Geographical_Region is a named vector:\ntable(df$Geographical_Region)\n#&gt; \n#&gt;                   Africa                 Americas                     Asia \n#&gt;                       47                       27                       30 \n#&gt;                   Europe Mid. East & North Africa                   Ocenia \n#&gt;                       39                       17                        6\n\n# Names:\nnames(table(df$Geographical_Region))\n#&gt; [1] \"Africa\"                   \"Americas\"                \n#&gt; [3] \"Asia\"                     \"Europe\"                  \n#&gt; [5] \"Mid. East & North Africa\" \"Ocenia\"\n\nGoing back to our hypothetical barplot, we can provide it a names argument. Let’s say the numbers 5, 10, 12 and 7 correspond to Orange, Banana, Apple, Pear.\n\nbarplot(height = c(5,10,12,7), names.arg = c(\"Orange\", \"Banana\", \"Apple\", \"Pear\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor easier read and navigation, it is a good idea to use a systematic way to write the code. You can press  after the end of the first argument.\n\n# easier to read code\nbarplot(height = c(5,10,12,7), \n        names.arg = c(\"Orange\", \"Banana\", \"Apple\", \"Pear\")\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we have a very good idea how barplot() works.\nGoing back to the bar plot for Geographical_Region, the category “Mid.

A function usually gets an object (or objects), and returns something, such as a graph.\nYou can use the help() function to read more about a specific function. For example, let’s read the help file for barplot().\n\nhelp(barplot)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Help tab explaining barplot()\n\n\n\nAn input of a function is called an argument.

    "section": "3.5 Visual summary",
    "text": "3.5 Visual summary\nWhen working on a new dataset, it is always a good idea to start by visually summarizing your variables of interest one-by-one. This will help you to get a better understanding of the data.\nFor a numerical variable, two types of graphs are appropriate for a visual summary:\n- Histogram\n- Box plot\n\n3.5.1 Histogram\n\n# histogram:\nhist(df$Life_exp_female)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can tell R how many bins you would like to have in your histogram by using the breaks argument, but as the R help file clarifies, this number is a suggestion only, and R can use a different (but similar value) to draw a pretty histogram.\n\n# histogram with fewer bins\nhist(df$Life_exp_female, breaks = 5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# histogram with higher number of bins\nhist(df$Life_exp_female, breaks = 30)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might want to specify cut points. For example, you might want to have a sequence from 40 to 100 with increment of 5.\n\n# a sequence from 40 to 100 by 5\nseq(from = 40, to = 100, by = 5)\n#&gt;  [1]  40  45  50  55  60  65  70  75  80  85  90  95 100\n\n# put it into an object\nmy_breaks &lt;- seq(from = 40, to = 100, by = 5)\n# this will be our break points\n\n#tell R to do the histogram using these points\nhist(df$Life_exp_female, breaks = my_breaks)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis looks quite nice and intuitive. However, titles are not defined. I don’t want to see df$Life_exp_female as an axis or main graph title.\n\n#Histogram with titles and breaks\nhist(df$Life_exp_female, \n     breaks = my_breaks, \n     main = \"Female Life Expectancy in 2010\",\n     ylab = \"Number of Countries\",\n     xlab = \"Age\"\n     )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Box plots\nA box plot is another option for graphically summarising a numerical variable. Box graphs are really nice to get a sense of the data, understand the distribution, and quickly see if there are any outliers. They are also very good at creating visual comparisons across groups, something which we will cover in the upcoming weeks.\n\n# Boxplot\nboxplot(df$Life_exp_female,\n        main = \"Female Life Expectancy in 2010\",\n        ylab = \"Age\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis box plot helps us to visualize the five-point summary. You can see minimum, max, median and first and third quartiles.\nIf you don’t believe me, we can plot these over the boxplot.\n\n# box plot:\nboxplot(df$Life_exp_female,\n        main = \"Female Life Expectancy in 2010\",\n        ylab = \"Age\")\n\n# you can add a line to a plot by abline\n# h stands for horizontal\n# tell R to draw a horizontal line at the median of Life_exp_female\nabline(h = median(df$Life_exp_female))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can draw lines for each statistic.\n\n# box plot:\nboxplot(df$Life_exp_female,\n        main = \"Female Life Expectancy in 2010\",\n        ylab = \"Age\")\n\n# median\nabline(h = median(df$Life_exp_female))\n\n# min\nabline(h = min(df$Life_exp_female))\n\n# max\nabline(h = max(df$Life_exp_female))\n\n# first quartile\nabline(h = quantile(df$Life_exp_female, probs = 0.25))\n\n# third quartile\nabline(h = quantile(df$Life_exp_female, probs = 0.75))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe drew these lines for demonstration purposes only. It is to learn that a box plot visualizes the information in a five-point summary. Normally, we wouldn’t show them this way because we can assume the reader knows how to read a box plot.",
